    This is a very simple package with only one function `tgme`. The aim of this 
    package is to send you a message when a job on Rstudio server is done (or on
    your local machine).
    
    It is a free alternative to the [Rich Pauloo's](https://github.com/richpauloo) 
    [`textme`](https://github.com/richpauloo/textme) package.

    The goal of `HBVr` is to ease the accessebility of [HBV Global Parameter 
    maps](http://www.gloh2o.org/hbv/) created by Beck et al. ([2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031485)). 
    Therefore this one-function package allows to download any of the cross-validation 
    folds for your particular area of interest (AOI).
