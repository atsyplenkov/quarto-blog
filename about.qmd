After a hydrologist license in Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSc.) and several research trips to mountains (Kamchatka and Caucasus), where I was mostly interested in water quality issues (particularly suspended sediments), I became a hydrology/geomorphology Ph.D. student in the pursuit of multi-disciplinarity – the only efficient way to address real-world problems and fundamental science.

Following my Ph.D. defense at Lomonosov Moscow State University in December 2019, I received a Junior Research Fellow position in the Laboratory of Fluvial Processes and Soil Erosion at Faculty of Geography. Since May 2023 I am working as a Scientist-Geomorphologist at [Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/).
