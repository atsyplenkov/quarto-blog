When I'm trying to run code from [SoilGrids WebDAV tutorial](https://git.wur.nl/isric/soilgrids/soilgrids.notebooks/-/blob/master/markdown/webdav_from_R.md) I am receiving a following error:\n\n> `ERROR 11: CURL error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`\n\nI never managed to fix this issue, so I decided to let it go since everyone is slowly quitting GDAL anyway. Here is my approach to downloading cropped and reprojected SoilGrids raster. There was a really great [tutorial](https://rpubs.com/ials2un/soilgrids_webdav) by Ivan Lizarazo on getting several SoilGrids layers using `rgdal`. My approach is mostly based on it.\n\nFirst of all, let's load some boundary layer, i.e., our area of interest (AOI). I will use the default `sf` sample data for North Carolina counties. To reduce the size of AOI, let me select only the first county. The SoilGrids files are stored in Interrupted Goode Homolosine, so I have to reproject our AOI polygon to it.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# Load sample data\nnc <-  st_read(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\",\n                         package = \"sf\"),\n               quiet = T) %>% \n  slice(1)\n\n# Transform to IGH projection\nigh <- '+proj=igh +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'\nnc_igh <- st_transform(nc, igh)\n\n```\n\n### 2. Download urls\nNow Let's just copy download urls from previous [tutorials](https://rpubs.com/ials2un/soilgrids_webdav). And create a link to every other separate `.vrt` file, since we are gonna `purrr::map` them later. I'm interested only in mean topsoil characteristics (i.e. 0-30 cm) right now. So I will download sand, silt, and clay content and soil organic carbon content (soc).\n\n```{r}\nsg_url <- \"/vsicurl/https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/latest/data/\"\nprops <- c(\"sand\", \"silt\", \"clay\", \"soc\")\nlayers <- c(\"0-5\", \"5-15\", \"15-30\")\n\nvrt <- paste0(props, \"/\",\n               props, \"_\",\n               rep(layers, 4),\n               \"cm_mean.vrt\")\n\nvrt[1]\n```\n\nThen, we need to create a list of paths to save. Let's create a directory `soilgrid` where we are going to download our layers.\n\n```{r}\n# Optional\n# Check if the directory exists\nif (!dir.exists(\"soilgrid\")) {dir.create(\"soilgrid\")}\n\n\n# Create paths\nlfile <- paste0(\n  \"soilgrid/\",\n  props, \"_\",\n  rep(layers, 4),\n  \".tif\")\n\nlfile[1]\n```\n\n### 3. Download and preprocess function\nMy general idea is to crop the SoilGrid layer to the bounding box, reproject to my CRS (i.e. CRS of the `nc` layer), download, and then write as `.tif`. However, I want to do this for `r length(lfile)` rasters. Therefore, we need to write a function we are going to apply:\n\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(terra)\n\n# Function to download and transform soilgrid layers\nsoilgrids_download <- function(list_vrt, # download url\n                               list_lfile, # destination path\n                               shape_igh, # AOI shape in IGH proj\n                               destproj){ # desired projection\n  \n  terra::rast(paste0(sg_url, list_vrt)) %>% # read raster\n    terra::crop(ext(vect(shape_igh))) %>%  # crop to bounding box\n    terra::project(destproj) %>%  # reproject\n    terra::writeRaster(list_lfile,\n                       overwrite = T) # Save\n  \n}\n```\n\nBefore running it in the loop, let's try it for the first layer.\n\n```{r}\n\nsoilgrids_download(list_vrt = vrt[1],\n                   list_lfile = lfile[1],\n                   shape_igh = nc_igh,\n                   destproj = st_crs(nc)$proj4string)\n\nrast(lfile[1]) %>% \n  plot()\n```\n\nIt worked!\n\n### 4. Map download\nNext, with the help of `purrr` we can apply this function to all our links. Let's measure elapsed time.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tictoc)\n\ntic()\nwalk2(vrt,\n      lfile,\n      ~soilgrids_download(.x, .y,\n                          shape_igh = nc_igh,\n                          destproj = st_crs(nc)$proj4string))\ntoc()\n\n```\n\nWell, almost 2 mins. It is necessary to improve the timing somehow. This process can be run in parallel with `furrr`.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(furrr)\n\n# Set Parallel\nno_cores <- availableCores() - 1\nplan(multisession,\n     workers = no_cores) \n\n# Download!\ntic()\nfuture_walk2(vrt, lfile,\n             ~soilgrids_download(.x, .y,\n                          shape_igh = nc_igh,\n                          destproj = st_crs(nc)$proj4string))\ntoc()\n\n# Exit parallel\nplan(sequential)\n\n```\n\nLess than 1 minute. As [Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) says, \"BAM!\". Three times faster! \n\n```{r}\n\nlist.files(\"soilgrid\")\n\n```\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"html-math-method":"katex","include-in-header":["../../includes.html"],"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"2022-03-05-soilgrids-terra.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","comments":{"giscus":{"repo":"atsyplenkov/quarto-blog"}},"theme":{"light":["cosmo","../../theme.scss"]},"toc-title":"Contents","title-block-banner":false,"title":"Accessing SoilGrids via {terra}","author":"Anatoly Tsyplenkov","date":"2022-03-05","categories":["R","soil erosion"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
