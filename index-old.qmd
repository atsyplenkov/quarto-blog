# Hi, I'm Anatoly Tsyplenkov.

I did my Ph.D. at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, where I was interested in the spatio-temporal variability of sediment transport in mountain areas, and a postdoc at the Institute of Geography Russian Academy of Science, where I focused on remote sensing and geomorphology in the Caucasus. While a hydrologist and fluvial geomorphologist at the core, I am fascinated by creative ways to visualize the data (what dataviz designers do), and by transformative technologies to extract and disseminate knowledge from data (what computer scientists do). My passion as a researcher is to integrate insights from these fields in a useful way to promote equitable and sustainable global access to safe water and energy.
