  abstract = {Basing on the generalization of data series obtained by automatic optical turbidity loggers, lowfrequency (20-minutes) changes in suspended solids concentrations in rivers of different types and size are considered. The turbulent nature of these fluctuations, corresponding to the low-frequency zone of the spectrum of ripple velocities of the river flow (macroturbulent fluctuations) is justified. The contribution of macroturbulent fluctuations to the synoptic variability of water turbidity was analyzed on the basis of the TI parameter, which is the ratio of the difference between maximum and minimum turbidity for a short period of time (Ti) (1 hour, with the measurement discreteness of 20 minutes) to the total difference of turbidity for a hydrological event (TГС). The higher values of TI correspond to the greater contribution of macroturbulent turbidity fluctuations to synoptic variability of sediment load caused by precipitation, snowmelt and ice melting. As the basin area increases, the amplitudes of ripple oscillations decrease. Their role in the overall variability of turbidity is maximum for small rivers. The heterogeneity of turbidity structure increases on rivers with the highest frequency of pulsations, i.e. their flow tends to be quasi homogeneous. The heterogeneity leads to the increased contribution of macroturbulent turbidity fluctuations to its synoptic oscillations.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the joint impact of catchment complexity in topography, tectonics, climate, landuse patterns, and lithology on the suspended sediment yield (SSY, t km−2 year−1) in the Caucasus region using measurements from 244 gauging stations (GS). A Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) was used to reveal the relationships between SSY and explanatory variables. Despite possible significant uncertainties on the SSY values, analysis of this database indicates clear spatial patterns of SSY in the Caucasus. Most catchments in the Lesser Caucasia and Ciscaucasia are characterized by relatively low SSY values (\&lt;100–150 t km−2 year−1), the Greater Caucasus region generally have higher SSY values (more than 150–300 t km−2 year−1). Partial correlation analyses demonstrated that such proxies of topography as height above nearest drainage (HAND) and normalized steepness index (Ksn) tend to be among the most important ones. However, a PLSR analysis suggested that these variables’ influence is likely associated with peak ground acceleration (PGA). We also found a strong relationship between land cover types (e.g., barren areas and cropland) and SSY in different elevation zones. Nonetheless, adding more gauging stations into analyses and more refined characterizations of the catchments may reveal additional trends.},

  abstract = {Vast areas of Europe were contaminated by the fallout of 137Cs and other radionuclides, as a result of the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The post-fallout redistribution of Chernobyl-derived 137Cs was associated with erosion and sediment transport processes within the fluvial system. Bottom sediments from lakes and reservoirs can provide a valuable source of information regarding the post-fallout redistribution and fate of 137Cs released by the Chernobyl accident. A detailed investigation of sediment-associated 137Cs in the bottom sediments of a reservoir in a Chernobyl-affected area in Central Russia has been undertaken. A new approach, based on the vertical distribution of 137Cs activity concentrations in the reservoir bottom sediment makes it possible to separate the initially deposited bottom sediment, where the 137Cs activity reflects the direct fallout of Chernobyl-derived 137Cs to the reservoir surface and its subsequent incorporation into sediment deposited immediately after the accident, from the sediment mobilized from the catchment deposited subsequently. The deposits representing direct fallout from the atmosphere was termed the “Chernobyl peak”. Its shape can be described by a diffusion equation and it can be distinguished from the remaining catchment-derived 137Cs associated with sediment accumulated with sediments during the post-Chernobyl period. The 137Cs depth distribution above the "Chernobyl peak" was used to provide a record of changes in the concentration of sediment-associated 137Cs transported from the upstream catchment during the post-Chernobyl period. It was found that the 137Cs activity concentration in the sediment deposited in the reservoir progressively decreased during the 30-year period after the accident due to a reduction in the contribution of sediment eroded from the arable land in the catchment. This reflects a reduction in both the area of cultivated land area and the reduced incidence of surface runoff from the slopes during spring snowmelt due to climate warming.},

  abstract = {The restructuring of the lower reach of the Koiavgan Creek channel (the right bank tributary of the Djankuat River) occurred on 1 July 2015 after continuous rainfall with a total precipitation amount of 227 mm. This led to the breakthrough of the Djankuat Glacier lateral moraine. The lower reach of the creek channel was initially formed at the junction of the bedrock slopes and lateral moraine and descended sharply at the end of the moraine to a wide glacial valley of the Djankuat River. The part of the channel from the end of the moraine line to the creek’s outlet in the bottom of the glacial valley had a height difference of 125 m at a distance of about 250 m. The active landslide has been recorded in the place of future breakthrough based on interpretation of 2014 summer satellite image. The linear erosion began to form on the wall of the disruption. Thermokarst processes probably also contributed to this breakthrough. The total volume of sediment eroded during the breakthrough and for four years after is 156 500 m               3               . The breakthrough has formed the largest sediment cone 300 meters wide and more than 200 m long in the bottom of the Djankuat River valley.},

Erosion pins arrays were installed at six key sections each with different bank lithology and morphology. Bank lithology (bedrock or alluvial deposits), morphology (vertical or concave) and orientation towards the local flow direction were the dominant factors controlling the rate of bank retreat and/or collapse. In contrast to alluvial banks, bedrock slopes are predominantly affected by chemical weathering processes in a wet subtropical climate. Results on sediment mobilization and volume removed are presented for different bank types. Variability in channel bank recessional dynamics is discussed in the context of hydrometeorological data (2016–2018) and an extreme flood.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study presents a dataset on long-term multidisciplinary glaciological, hydrological, and meteorological observations and isotope sampling in a sparsely monitored alpine zone of the North Caucasus in the Djankuat research basin. The Djankuat glacier, which is the largest in the basin, was chosen as representative of the central North Caucasus during the International Hydrological Decade and is one of 30 “reference” glaciers in the world that have annual mass balance series longer than 50 years (Zemp et al., 2009). The dataset features a comprehensive set of observations from 2007 to 2017 and contains yearly  measurements of snow depth and density; measurements of dynamics of snow and ice melting; measurements of water runoff, conductivity, turbidity, temperature, δ18O, δD at the main gauging station (844 samples in total) with an hourly or sub-daily time step depending on the parameter; data on δ18O and δ2H sampling of liquid precipitation, snow, ice, firn, and groundwater in different parts of the watershed taken regularly during melting season (485 samples in total); measurements of precipitation amount, air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave incoming and reflected radiation, longwave downward and upward radiation, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and direction – measured at several automatic weather stations within the basin with 15\,min to 1\,h time steps; gradient meteorological measurements to estimate turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture, measuring three components of wind speed at a frequency of 10\,Hz to estimate the impulse of turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat over the glacier surface by the eddy covariance method. Data were collected during the ablation period (June–September). The observations were halted in winter. The dataset is available from PANGAEA (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.894807, Rets et al., 2018a) and will be further updated. The dataset can be useful for developing and verifying hydrological, glaciological, and meteorological models for alpine areas, to study the impact of climate change on hydrology of mountain regions using isotopic and hydrochemical approaches in hydrology. As the dataset includes the measurements of hydrometeorological and glaciological variables during the catastrophic proglacial lake outburst in the neighboring Bashkara valley in September~2017, it is a valuable contribution to study lake outbursts.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Processes linked to climate change and intensified anthropogenic pressure influence the environment, the hydrology and by extent the denudation processes in the Caucasus mountain belt. Quantitative assessments of sediment fluxes and their temporal evolution in this mountain region are required for various environmental and engineering purposes, including the planning and maintenance of water reservoirs and other structures. In this paper, we present a first analysis of the hitherto largest suspended sediment yield (SSY) database for the Caucasus region, comprising data from 198 catchments ({$>$}\,4000 catchment-years of observations). We present an overview of the existing contemporary SSY data from gauging stations observations. Based on these data and different models, we propose preliminary maps of the spatial patterns of SSY and denudation rates in the Caucasus region.},

  abstract = {The overall increase in precipitation and the frequency of extreme rainfall is confirmed by several meteorological observations both on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus. In this context, research on the drivers of an extreme meteorological event becoming a severe flood and an extreme geomorphological (erosion) event becomes especially important. The article analyses the factors contributing to the development of a flash flood on the watershed of the river Tsanyk (Great Sochi area) and estimates its geomorphological impact. Analysis of hydrologic-meteorological situation during the Tsanyk flood on 7-9 September 2018 and in the previous period showed that the event is unique for the investigated watershed from the hydrologic perspective. After a prolonged period without precipitation, the rainfall on 7-8 September resulted in a flash flood with a rapid water level rise (117 cm in 40 min). We determined the rates and volumes of channel erosion based on a repeated survey of the channel section, estimation of the speed and length of the banks being flushed out, composed of loose sediments and bedrock using the pin method. The amount of erosion on the banks composed of loosened sediments is on average 2-3 times higher than on the flysch banks. At the same time, the material export for one erosion event in September 2018 is comparable (or even exceeds) the total amount of bank erosion for the year, previously identified based on stationary observations.},

  abstract = {Purpose The sediment dynamics of (peri-)glacial catchments can be highly variable and complex. Understanding these dynamics and their underlying causes is not only of interest from a scientific perspective but also required to address the practical problems with which they are often associated. In order to better understand the sediment dynamics of glaciated mountainous catchments, suspended sediment fluxes in the 9.1 km2 Djankuat catchment (North Caucasus, Russia) were monitored intensively during the 2017 ablation season. Materials and methods The intra-event suspended sediment dynamics were studied using a newly proposed simple hysteresis index (SHI), quantifying to what extent evolutions in sediment concentration are characterized by a clockwise or anticlockwise hysteresis loop. Results and discussion The resulting catchment suspended sediment yield was 1033 t km−2 year−1, with the glacier itself contributing 72\% of the suspended sediment load. However, during rainfall events, also hillslope erosion in the proglacial area became a very significant sediment source. Clockwise hysteresis loops occurred in 61.8\% of the events, while anticlockwise in 11.8\%. On the other hand, only 47.8\% of the total suspended sediment flux was transported during clockwise events. Our observations clearly indicate that events showing a stronger clockwise pattern (i.e., a higher SHI) are associated with a larger sediment input from the proglacial area. Conclusions Overall, our results provide data and insights on sediment dynamics in an understudied environment. They illustrate that the type and characteristics of sediment concentration hysteresis loops are to some extent linked to the dominant sediment sources during the event. As such, the proposed methodology and SHI may also help with a better understanding of sediment dynamics in other environments.},
